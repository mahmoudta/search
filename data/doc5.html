      <h1>TO A LADY WHO SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF POETS</h1>

<h2>by: Washington Allston (1779-1843)</h2>
<p>
<strong>o<strong>H, censure not the Poet's art,<br>
Nor think it chills the feeling heart<br>
To love the gentle Muses.<br>
Can that which in a stone or flower,<br>
As if by transmigrating power,<br>
His gen'rous soul infuses;
</p><p>
Can that for social joys impair<br>
The heart that like the lib'ral air<br>
All Nature's self embraces;<br>
That in the cold Norwegian main,<br>
Or mid the tropic hurricane<br>
Her varied beauty traces;
</p><p>
That in her meanest work can find<br>
A fitness and a grace combin'd<br>
In blest harmonious union,<br>
That even with the cricket holds,<br>
As if by sympathy of souls,<br>
Mysterious communion;
</p><p>
Can that with sordid selfishness<br>
His wide-expanded heart impress,<br>
Whose consciousness is loving;<br>
Who, giving life to all he spies,<br>
His joyous being multiplies,<br>
In youthfulness improving?
</p><p>
Oh, Lady, then, fair queen of Earth,<br>
Thou loveliest of mortal birth,<br>
Spurn not thy truest lover;<br>
Nor censure him whose keener sense<br>
Can feel thy magic influence<br>
Where nought the world discover;
</p><p>
Whose eye on that bewitching face<br>
Can every source unnumber'd trace<br>
Of germinating blisses;<br>
See Sylphids o'er thy forehead weave<br>
The lily-fibred film, and leave<br>
It fix'd with honied kisses;
</p><p>
While some within thy liquid eyes,<br>
Like minnows of a thousand dies<br>
Through lucid waters glancing,<br>
In busy motion to and fro,<br>
The gems of diamond-beetles sow,<br>
Their lustre thus enhancing;
</p><p>
Here some, their little vases fill'd<br>
With blushes for thy cheek distill'd<br>
From roses newly blowing,<br>
Each tiny thirsting pore supply;<br>
And some in quick succession by<br>
The down of peaches strewing;
</p><p>
There others who from hanging bell<br>
Of cowslip caught the dew that fell<br>
While yet the day was breaking,<br>
And o'er thy pouting lips diffuse<br>
The tincture--still its glowing hues<br>
Of purple morn partaking:
</p><p>
Here some, that in the petals prest<br>
Of humid honeysuckles, rest<br>
From nightly fog defended,<br>
Flutter their fragrant wings between,<br>
Like humming-birds that scarce are seen,<br>
They seem with air so blended!
</p><p>
While some, in equal clusters knit.<br>
On either side in circles flit,<br>
Like bees in April swarming,<br>
Their tiny weight each other lend,<br>
And force the yielding cheek to bend,<br>
Thy laughing dimples forming.
</p><p>
Nor, Lady, think the Poet's eye<br>
Can only outward charms espy,<br>
Thy form alone adoring--<br>
Ah, Lady, no: though fair they be.<br>
Yet he a fairer sight may see,<br>
Thy lovely soul exploring:
</p><p>
And while from part to part it flies<br>
The gentle Spirit he descries,<br>
Through every line pursuing;<br>
And feels upon his nature shower<br>
That pure, that humanizing power,<br>
Which raises by subduing.
