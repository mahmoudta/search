    <h1>MUSIC ON CHRISTMAS MORNING</h1>

    <h2>by: Anne Bronte (1820-1849)</h2>
<p>
    <strong>M</strong>USIC I love--but never strain<br>
    Could kindle raptures so divine,<br>
    So grief assuage, so conquer pain,<br>
    And rouse this pensive heart of mine--<br>
    As that we hear on Christmas morn,<br>
    Upon the wintry breezes borne.</p>

  <p>Though Darkness still her empire keep,<br>
    And hours must pass, ere morning break;<br>
    From troubled dreams, or slumbers deep,<br>
    That music KINDLY bids us wake:<br>
    It calls us, with an angel's voice,<br>
    To wake, and worship, and rejoice;</p>
    <p>
    To greet with joy the glorious morn,<br>
    Which angels welcomed long ago,<br>
    When our redeeming Lord was born,<br>
    To bring the light of Heaven below;<br>
    The Powers of Darkness to dispel,<br>
    And rescue Earth from Death and Hell.
  </p><p>
    While listening to that sacred strain,<br>
    My raptured spirit soars on high;<br>
    I seem to hear those songs again<br>
    Resounding through the open sky,<br>
    That kindled such divine delight,<br>
    In those who watched their flocks by night.
</p><p>
    With them I celebrate His birth--<br>
    Glory to God, in highest Heaven,<br>
    Good-will to men, and peace on earth,<br>
    To us a Saviour-king is given;<br>
    Our God is come to claim His own,<br>
    And Satan's power is overthrown!
</p><p>
    A sinless God, for sinful men,<br>
    Descends to suffer and to bleed;<br>
    Hell MUST renounce its empire then;<br>
    The price is paid, the world is freed,<br>
    And Satan's self must now confess<br>
    That Christ has earned a RIGHT to bless:
</p><p>
    Now holy Peace may smile from heaven,<br>
    And heavenly Truth from earth shall spring:<br>
    The captive's galling bonds are riven,<br>
    For our Redeemer is our king;<br>
    And He that gave his blood for men<br>
    Will lead us home to God again.
