    <h1>ZIRA: IN CAPTIVITY</h1>

    <h2>translated into English by: Laurence Hope (1865-1904)</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>l</strong>OVE me a little, Lord, or let me go,<br>
    I am so weary walking to and fro<br>
    Through all your lonely halls that were so sweet<br>
    Did they but echo to your coming feet.
  </p><p>
    When by the flowered scrolls of lace-like stone<br>
    Our women's windows -- I am left alone,<br>
    Across the yellow Desert, looking forth,<br>
    I see the purple hills towards the north.
  </p><p>

    Behind those jagged Mountains' lilac crest<br>
    Once lay the captive bird's small rifled nest.<br>
    There was my brother slain, my sister bound;<br>
    His blood, her tears, drunk by the thirsty ground.
  </p><p>

    Then, while the burning village smoked on high,<br>
    And desecrated all the peaceful sky,<br>
    They took us captive, us, born frank and free.<br>
    On fleet, strong camels through the sandy sea.
  </p><p>

    Yet, when we rested, night-times, on the sand<br>
    By the rare waters of this weary land,<br>
    Our captors, ere the camp was wrapped in sleep,<br>
    Talked, and I listened, and forgot to weep.
  </p><p>

    "Is he not brave and fair?" they asked, "our King,<br>
    Slender as one tall palm-tree by a spring;<br>
    Erect, serene, with gravely brilliant eyes,<br>
    As deeply dark as are those desert skies.
  </p><p>

    "Truly no bitter fate," they said, and smiled,<br>
    "Awaits the beauty of this captured child!"<br>
    Then something in my heart began to sing,<br>
    And secretly I longed to see the King.
  </p><p>

    Sometimes the other maidens sat in tears,<br>
    Sometimes, consoled, they jested at their fears,<br>
    Musing what lovers Time to them would bring;<br>
    But I was silent, thinking of the King.
  </p><p>

    Till, when the weary endless sands were passed,<br>
    When, far to south, the city rose at last,<br>
    All speech forsook me and my eyelids fell,<br>
    Since I already loved my Lord so well.
  </p><p>

    Then the division: some were sent away<br>
    To merchants in the city; some, they say,<br>
    To summer palaces, beyond the walls.<br>
    But me they took straight to the Sultan's halls.
  </p><p>

    Every morning I would wake and say
    "Ah, sisters, shall I see our Lord to-day?"<br>
    The women robed me, perfumed me, and smiled;<br>
    "When were his feet unfleet to pleasure, child?"
  </p><p>

    And tales they told me of his deeds in war,<br>
    Of how his name was reverenced afar;<br>
    And, crouching closer in the lamp's faint glow,<br>
    They told me of his beauty, speaking low.
  </p><p>

    What need, what need? the women wasted art;<br>
    I loved you with every fibre of my heart<br>
    Already. My God! when did I not love you,<br>
    In life, in death, when shall I not love you?
  </p><p>

    You never seek me. All day long I lie<br>
    Watching the changes of the far-off sky<br>
    Behind the lattice-work of carven stone.<br>
    And all night long, alas! I lie alone.
  </p><p>

    But you come never. Ah, my Lord the King,<br>
    How can you find it well to do this thing?<br>
    Come once, come only: sometimes, as I lie,<br>
    I doubt if I shall see you first, or die.
  </p><p>

    Ah, could I hear your footsteps at the door<br>
    Hallow the lintel and caress the floor,<br>
    Then I might drink your beauty, satisfied,<br>
    Die of delight, ere you could reach my side.
  </p><p>

    Alas, you come not, Lord: life's flame burns low,<br>
    Faint for a loveliness it may not know,<br>
    Faint for your face, Oh, come -- come soon to me --<br>
    Lest, though you should not, Death should, set me free!
