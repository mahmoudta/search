    <h1>THE TREE OF LIFE</h1>

    <h2>by: Robert Buchanan (1841-1901)</h2>

    <p>
    <strong>T</strong>HE MASTER said:<br>
    ‘I have planted the Seed of a Tree,<br>
    It shall be strangely fed<br>
    With white dew and with red,<br>
    And the Gardeners shall be three--<br>
    Regret, Hope, Memory!’</p>

<p> The Master smiled:<br>
    For the Seed that He had set<br>
    Broke presently thro’ the mould,<br>
    With a glimmer of green and gold,<br>
    And the Angels’ eyes were wet--<br>
    Hope, Memory, Regret.</p>

    <p>The Master cried:<br>
    ‘It liveth--breatheth--see!<br>
    Its soft lips open wide--<br>
    It looks from side to side--<br>
    How strange they gleam on me,<br>
    The little dim eyes of the Tree!’</p>

    <p>The Master said:<br>
    ‘After a million years,<br>
    The Seed I set and fed<br>
    To itself hath gatherèd<br>
    All the world’s smiles and tears--<br>
    How mighty it appears!’</p>

    <p>The Master said:<br>
    ‘At last, at last, I see<br>
    A Blossom, a Blossom o’ red<br>
    From the heart of the Tree is shed.<br>
    ’Tis fairer certainly<br>
    Than the Tree, or the leaves of the Tree.'</p>

    <p>The Master cried:<br>
    ‘O Angels, that guard the Tree,<br>
    A Blossom, a Blossom divine<br>
    Grows on this greenwood of mine:<br>
    What may this Blossom be?<br>
    Name this Blossom to me!’</p>

    <p>The Master smiled;<br>
    For the Angels answered thus:<br>
    ‘Our tears have nourish’d the same,<br>
    We have given it a name<br>
    That seemeth fit to us--<br>
    We have called it Spiritus.’</p>

    <p>The Master said:<br>
    ‘This Flower no Seed shall bear;<br>
    But hither on a day<br>
    My beautiful Son shall stray,<br>
    And shall snatch it unaware,<br>
    And wreath it in his hair.’</p>

  <p>The Master smiled:<br>
    ‘The Tree shall never bear--<br>
    Seedless shall perish the Tree,<br>
    But the Flower my Son’s shall be;<br>
    He will pluck the Flower and wear,<br>
    Till it withers in his hair!’</p>
