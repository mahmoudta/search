    <h1>ZUDORA-(from "Turns and Movies")</h1>
    <h2>by: Conrad Aiken (1889-1973)</h2>


<p>
  <strong>H</strong>ERE on the pale beach, in the darkness;<br>
    With the full moon just to rise;<br>
    They sit alone, and look over the sea,<br>
    Or into each other's eyes. . .
</p><p>
    She pokes her parasol into the sleepy sand,<br>
    Or sifts the lazy whiteness through her hand.
</p><p>
    'A lovely night,' he says, 'the moon,<br>
    Comes up for you and me.<br>
    Just like a blind old spotlight there,<br>
    Fizzing across the sea!'
</p><p>
    She pays no heed, nor even turns her head:<br>
    He slides his arm around her waist instead.
</p><p>
    'Why don't we do a sketch together--<br>
    Those songs you sing are swell.<br>
    Where did you get them, anyway?<br>
    They suit you awfully well.'
</p><p>
    She will not turn to him--will not resist.<br>
    Impassive, she submits to being kissed.
</p><p>
    'My husband wrote all four of them.<br>
    You know,--my husband drowned.<br>
    He was always sickly, soon depressed. . .'<br>
    But still she hears the sound
</p><p>
    Of a stateroom door shut hard, and footsteps going<br>
    Swiftly and steadily, and the dark sea flowing.
</p><p>
    She hears the dark sea flowing, and sees his eyes<br>
    Hollow with disenchantment, sick surprise,--
</p><p>
    And hate of her whom he had loved too well. . .<br>
    She lowers her eyes, demurely prods a shell.
</p><p>
    'Yes. We might do an act together.<br>
    That would be very nice.'<br>
    He kisses her passionately, and thinks<br>
    She's carnal, but cold as ice.
